# git
Generally we shoulf think a git project is made up of three folders or directories:
1- Working directory: Any changes made without saving, tracking or adding to stagging directory.
2- Staging area or staging directory: Here we added our changes from previous stage: modifying files contents, adding new files to our repo.
3- Repository or remote directory: Here is what we have pushed to remote server through other teams or colleagues can pull our projects.
Working directory --> Staging area --> Repository

First we should install git to our work station by typing the following command.
sudo apt-get install git
To check git installation, you should type the following command: 
git --version

Later, let us suppose there is a remote repo we want to pull and contribute in it.
So First we should clone it to our local by typing the following command: 
git clone https://repo_url
